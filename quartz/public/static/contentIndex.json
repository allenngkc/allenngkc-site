Which means that the option contracts expiring on Aug 2nd are overpriced. I am not sure how exactly comparing IV and HV can find out whether an option contract is overvalued or undervalued, but it is what it is.\nInstitutional Protection\n\nWe can see on Aug 2nd, there are both a spike on put and call open interests, of which are at 22.5 and 30 respectively. That means if PLTR blew past 30 a share by the expiration date. Hedge funds are gonna be paying up lot of money to wallstreetbets degenerates. Same thing around if the price drops below 22.5. So that’s what I meant by Institutional Protection, the big money in the market is in our favor. (Kinda)\nTechnical Analysis\n\nNow I know technical analysis don’t fucking matter, so does my life. But here the red horizontal lines represents the potential trade we’re going to take. Like I said above we are shorting volatility. So as long as until Aug 2nd PLTR stays between 22.50 and 30.00 we are good. Viewing from this TA we can see PLTR broke the upward channel few weeks ago, also, just 2 weeks ago it even broke a strong resistance at 27.05 as seen on the grey line. Overall it is bullish. I believe PLTR in the next 2 weeks will retest the resistance, possibly dropping below 27.00. Rising above $30.00 is unlikely as explained above in the call open interests.\nChoosing Iron Condor over Short Straddle\nA Short Straddle provides zero upside and downside protection\n\nIf we look at the chart from optionsprofitcalculator.com, you can see until expiry as long as PLTR stays between 22.50 and 30.00, we are taking a profit of $70, BUT, with unlimited risk, that’s crazy. So we are not placing this trade. Instead take a look at the Iron Condor I’ve made.\n\nNow with a maximum risk of 115, that is if PLTR rise above 31.50, and if PLTR drops below 22.50, we are only losing 15 max no matter how much it dropped. So, that’s 30.4% return on this trade (741% annual return)\nAdding both of these risks we are earning 35, now you might ask, I could have earned 75 in the first place if I did a short straddle! Well then just double down on the Iron Conder and buy 2 contracts. Now you’d be risking 230 to earn 70. As opposed to you could be losing an unpredictable amount of money if it’s OTM on expiry.\nIn summary, buy and sell a put at 22 and 22.5, buy and sell a call at 31.5 and 30. In total these 4 legs should net us $35 per contract.\nTL;DR: Iron Condor on PLTR placed on 2024-07-18, if PLTR stays between 22.50 and 30.00 by 2024-08-02, I will be profiting 35 per contract, with a upward risk of 115."},"Finance/Trading/Implied-Volatility":{"slug":"Finance/Trading/Implied-Volatility","filePath":"Finance/Trading/Implied Volatility.md","title":"Implied Volatility","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Implied Volatility is what the market thinks the underlying will move based on what prices we are current at."},"Finance/Trading/Options/Iron-Condors":{"slug":"Finance/Trading/Options/Iron-Condors","filePath":"Finance/Trading/Options/Iron Condors.md","title":"Iron Condors","links":["Straddle"],"tags":[],"content":"Choosing Iron Condor Wings\n\nWhen determining our condor wings, there is a systematic way of doing it.\n\n\nPrice our Straddle\n\nLet’s say we decided to sell a 20 put and a 20 call → -$3\n\n\nDetermine Conviction\n\nFinding out the probability of price exceeding our Straddle to determine the spread of the wing\n\n\n1 or 2 Standard Deviation\n\n**20 +- Price of Straddle**, so 17 and $23, if we are doing a earnings trade, expand it to 2 times the Price of Straddle\n\n\n"},"Finance/Trading/Volatility":{"slug":"Finance/Trading/Volatility","filePath":"Finance/Trading/Volatility.md","title":"Volatility","links":["Finance/Trading/Implied-Volatility"],"tags":[],"content":"Volatility essentially means the rate of change in price\n3 Circles of Volatility\n\nMarket Volatility - General momentum of the market (Bull, Bear)\nNon-Event Volatility - How does one individual stock moves day-to-day basis (AAPL vs KO)\nEvent Volatility - Earnings, Product Releases, Shareholders Meetings\n\nImplied Volatility vs Forecast Volatility"},"Math/Algebraic-Vectors":{"slug":"Math/Algebraic-Vectors","filePath":"Math/Algebraic Vectors.md","title":"Algebraic Vectors","links":["Math/Vectors"],"tags":[],"content":"In Geometric Vector, which characteristics are defined in Vectors.
