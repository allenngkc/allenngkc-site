Recall the tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at x=a:

$$y = f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$

For functions $f: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we have the surface $z=f(x,y)$ and thus a tangent plane at $(a,b)$

The tangent plane should contain $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$

General equation of a plane through $(a,b,f(a,b))$:

$$z=f(a,b)+m(x-a)+n(y-b)$$

$m, n$ are the slope constants of the plane

$m = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b)$, $n=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b)$

Definition: The tangent plane to $z=f(x,y)$ at $(a,b,f(a,b))$ is:

$$f(a,b)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b)(x-a)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b)(y-b)$$

Example: Determine the equation of the tangent plane to the surface $z=6-x^2-y^2$ at $(1,2,1)$

$$z=f(1,2)+f_{x}(1,2)(x-1)+f_{y}(1,2)(y-2)$$
$$\implies z=1-2(x-1)-4(y-2)$$
