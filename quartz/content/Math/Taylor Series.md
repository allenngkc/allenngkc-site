Let $f$ have derivatives of all orders at $x_{0}$. The Taylor series of $f(x)$ about $x_{0}$ is:
$$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{f^{k}(x_{0})}{k!}(x-x_{0})^k$$
If $x_0 = 0$, this is typically referred to as the Maclaurin Series

> In order for a Taylor Series to exist on an interval $I$, all derivatives of $f$ must be bounded for all values of $x$ on $I$

>[!tip] The Taylor Series for $f(x)$ converges to $f(x)$ on the interval of convergence
