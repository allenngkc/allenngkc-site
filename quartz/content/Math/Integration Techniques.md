### By Parts

$$\int udv = uv-\int vdu$$

>[!tip] u - what is easy to differentiate or don't know antiderivative

>[!tip] dv - what we know antiderivative of or tedious to differentiate

[]
##### LIATE Rule to choose u:
1. Logarithm
2. Inverse 
3. Algebraic
4. Trigonometric
5. Exponential
$$\int f(x)g'(x)dx = f(x)g(x)-\int g(x)f'(x)dx$$
