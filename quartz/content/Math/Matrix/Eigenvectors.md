Consider a linear transformation A from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. A non-zero vector is an eigenvector, and a scalar is an eigenvalue of 
$$Av=\lambda v$$
The eigenvector v represents a special direction for the linear transformation . In this direction, the transformation A scales the vector by a factor of $\lambda$


#### Find the eigenvalues of matrix A

Given the definition above,
$$(A-\lambda I)v=0\implies|a-\lambda I|=0$$
where $A$ = Matrix, $I$ = Identity Matrix
 
> $n\times n$ matrix can have up to n eigenvalues and eigenvectors

#### Find the eigenvectors of matrix A

given
$$(A-\lambda I)x=0$$

$$Ax=\lambda x \implies A(cx)=\lambda (cx)$$
