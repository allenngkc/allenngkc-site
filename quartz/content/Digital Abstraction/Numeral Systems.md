### Numeral Systems Conversion

#### Decimal to Binary

Suppose an integer $42$, we keep dividing it by $2$, we get
$$42/2=21, \;r=0 $$
$$21/2=10\;r=1$$
$$....$$
Once the number reaches $0$, We obtain the reminders and go **bottoms-up**. We get that $42_{10}$ = $101010_{2}$

#### Binary to Decimal

Suppose $10001_{2}$, we perform the following:
$$2^{4}\times1 + 2^{3}\times0+2^{2}\times0+2^{1}\times0\times1=17_{10}$$

#### Hex - Decimal - Binary
