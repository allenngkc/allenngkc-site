###### Centripetal Force: $\vec{F_{c}}$, net force that causes $a_{c}$

###### Equations are as follows:
$F_{c}=ma_{c}$ | $F_{c}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$

#### What sorts of things move in a circle?
1. Washer on a string (Tension)
2. Car or train travelling in a circle (Friction)
3. Planets (Gravity)

> There must be a force towards the center if something is moving in a circle

###### Tension, normal force, gravity. friction are the forces that cause centripetal force, thus motion

> If friction is not enough in going circle, the car would slide off
