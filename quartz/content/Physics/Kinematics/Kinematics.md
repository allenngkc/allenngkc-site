Kinematics: the study of motion without consider [[Forces]] that **produce** the motion, while [[Dynamics]] is the study to the **cause** of motion.

### Relationship with scalars and vectors

When we describe motion, we divide different variables into 2 categories. [[Scalar]], and [[Vectors]].

###### Scalar: quantities that have only a magnitude (number)
> Example: Distance, [[Speed]] 

###### Vectors: takes magnitude and direction into account
> Example: [[Displacement]], [[Velocity]],  [[Acceleration]]


### Free Falling Objects

An object falling from a height where the only force is [[Gravity]]

> Process are as follows: you throw a ball upward, it will move upward for a time, stop, change direction, and then move downward.

All under the influence of the [[Acceleration]] due to [[Gravity]]
