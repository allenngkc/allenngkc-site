Belongs in [[Vectors]], is a measure of how velocity changes with time, the unit for acceleration is m/s squared

> When an object's velocity is changing, that object is accelerating

##### Average Acceleration 
the change in velocity divided by the time interval for that change, during this interval is

$$a_{av} = \frac{\vec{\Delta v}}{\vec{\Delta t}}$$
##### Instantaneous Acceleration
Equals to the slope of the velocity-time graph at a particular instant in time.

##### Acceleration in Two Dimensions
As we all know
$$\vec{a_{av}}=\frac{\vec{v_{f}}-\vec{v_{i}}}{\vec{\Delta}t}$$
Refer to [[Displacement]], under **Displacement in Two Dimension**, and **Subtracting Vectors In Two Dimensions** in [[Vectors]], to find the acceleration in two dimension, simply divide the change in velocity by time.

A sample answer would be $0.8m/s^2[E63S]$
