 Displacement is one of the quantities under [[Vectors]], it's the change in position of an object taking consideration of direction

> In other words, only the result matters when it comes to calculation

##### For one-dimensional motion, displacement is written as

$$
\vec{\Delta}d = d_{2} - d_{1}
$$
$$\vec{\Delta}d: change\:in\:displacment, \:\: d_{2}: object's\:final\:position,\:\:d_{1}:object's\:initial\:position$$

### Displacement in Two Dimensions

There are 3 methods for determining total displacement:

##### 1. Scale Diagram

Draw the vectors tip to tail and to the proper scale on a graph. Then determine the total displacement by measuring the length of the vector and its angle.

> This method gives you a visual sense of how displacements relate, but it is not the most accurate way of doing so.
##### 2. Cosine / Sine Laws

First draw the two vectors tip to tail, Then apply the cosine and sine laws

>Using Sine and Cosine laws is accurate, only you can only combine two vectors at a time.

##### 3. Perpendicular Components (Best Method)

Divide the vector into x-component and y-component, then subtract the vectors seperately. Finally combine the components with pythagorean theorem. And find the angle with tangent.

Use SOH CAH TOA to find xy component vectors.

> The displacement vector can be broken down into its perpendicular xy components

##### Adding Vectors Algebraically 

After separating a vector into its perpendicular components. We want to combine all the horizontal vectors $(\vec{\Delta}d_{1x}+\vec{\Delta}d_{2x})$ and all the vertical vectors $(\vec{\Delta}d_{1y}+\vec{\Delta}d_{2y})$ 


Suppose  $\vec{\Delta}d_{x}$ is the total x-component, and $\vec{\Delta}d_{y}$ for total y-component.

The magnitude of $\vec{\Delta}d_{tot}$ is given by the Pythagorean theorem.

$$|\vec{\Delta}d_{tot}|=\sqrt{(\vec{\Delta}d_{x})^2+(\vec{\Delta}d_{y})^2}$$
and the angle between the total vector is given by

$$\theta = \tan^-1(\frac{|\vec{\Delta}d_{y}|}{|\vec{\Delta}d_{x}|})$$
