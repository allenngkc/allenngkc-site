While with [[Speed]], are related quantities, but they are not the same. Velocity belongs to [[Vectors]], meaning the consideration of magnitude and direction

velocity: the change in position divided by the time interval

> velocity can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the situation, represents the respective direction 
> 	(Up, down, left, right, forward, backward, compass bearings)

##### Average Velocity
The displacement divided by the time interval for that change, ** the slope of a secant on a position-time graph**
