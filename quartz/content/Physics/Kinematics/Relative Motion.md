wThe concept of relative motion is all about understanding frame of reference. It's all about the observer

When dealing in these situations, you can state the velocity of an object with respect to its reference frame

$$V_{AC} = V_{AB} + V_{BC}$$
$V_{AC}$ = velocity of A with respect to C
$V_{AB}$ = velocity of A with respect to B
$V_{BC}$ = velocity of B with respect to C

Then combine the velocities using vector addition in [[Displacement]]
