As picture above, projectile motion is where an object is threw upwards at an angle

> ** In projectile motion, we take x and y directions independently.
> ** The only force acting on an object is gravity

###### Important points to take note
1. Horizontal velocity is always constant ($\vec{a_x}=0$)
2. Vertical [[Acceleration]] is constant ($\vec{a_x}=g$)
3. Use SOH CAH TOA to find x-y components
4. Time is a interchangeable variable in x y

#### The Range Equation

Only works on $\vec{\Delta{d_{y}}}$ = 0, but we only need $v_{i}, \theta$ to find $\vec{\Delta{d_{x}}}$

![[screenshot_range.png|250]]

We have the following range equation to find $\vec{\Delta{d_{x}}}$
$$\vec\Delta{d_{x}}=\frac{v_{i}^2}{g}sin2\theta$$
In some sense, the most ideal $\theta$ is 45, where the maximum range is $\frac{V_{i}^2}{g}$

To find the elasped time:
$$\vec\Delta{t}=\frac{2V_{i}sin\theta}{g}$$
To find the maximum height of projectile motion using range equation, we can first find the elasped time, divide $\vec{\Delta{t}}$ by $2$, then apply [[Five Equations of Motions]]
