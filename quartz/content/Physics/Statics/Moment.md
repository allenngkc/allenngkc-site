- Sometimes called a Torque
- In addition to driving translation of a body. **A force can tend to drive rotation of a body about an axis.**

Position Vector, $r$
Moment Vector, $M=r\times F$

> If $F$ and $r$ are not perpendicular and are easily expressed in vector notation, then cross product is often preferable.

#### Moment Questions

We know that $M=r\times F$

> $F$ stands for the force component with directions Ex: $F=240(cos(10)i - sin10j)[N]$

> $r$ stands for the distance component with directions Ex:
> $r=0.030i + 0.350j[m]$

Then we cross it by $a1b2-a2b1$, more on [[Cross Product]]

State whether it's Counter Clockwise or Clockwise

### Couple

A couple is a moment produced by two equal. opposite and non-colinear forces.

> The forces sum to zero, but they still drive rotation

$M=F(a+d)-Fa = Fd$

### Principle of Moment

The moment of the resultant force about any point O equals to the sum of the moments of the original forces of the system about the same point O
