##### Uniform Circular Motion
Motion of an object with constant speed, along a circular path with constant radius

We have $\vec{a_{c}}$, instantaneous acceleration towards the center of the circle

There are several formulas for centripetal acceleration:
$$a_{c}=\frac{v^2}{r},a_{c}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}, a_{c}=4\pi^2rf^2$$
given that $v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$, or $v=2\pi rf$

> At any point of circular motion, the acceleration keep changing direction, **tangent to the circumference**, due to a force acting towards towards the middle. Check [[Centripetal Force]]
