#### Tell Us about Yourself
My name is Allen, I am currently working towards the Systems Design Engineering degree at Waterloo, a little background for my coding experience, so as a kid like everyone I always enjoyed playing video games, It was when I was 12, 13. I was spending at least 5,6 hours per day playing video games, it kinda got to a point where I stopped enjoying it anymore. caused I got bored of it. And then there's this idea sparked my mind, What about making video games? So i spent a lot of time learning how to program, I will be completely honest I gave up a couple times, went back to video games, back and forth a couple times. Eventually I decided to stay consistent and somehow I managed to overcome the steep learning curve.

- Made a small mobile game and published Google Play
%% - Collaborated with other ppl online to make larger scale games, learnt Git %%
- Found out there's more than game dev in programming
- Python, javascrpt react for web applications
 - Found out that I am interested in software engineering field

- I realized can leverage my software development skills to solve actual real world problems or even giving back to my community.

- For example, I developed a management system for sneaker resellers in an online hackathon. This past summer, I worked to digitalize a company's client management system, at the end we re able to replace a lot of the traditional paper bookkeeping methods. Also, last year in highschool, I was able to give back my local community, since I have more experience in coding. Decided to take on the CS Club Pres Role.

Stereotypical parents wants me to be a doctor but now I can prove to them I don need to be a doctor or a surgeon to contribute.to the medical field but software something I actually enjoy doing can also contribute to th medical field


#### Strengths and Weaknesses
my biggest weakness is, sometimes i get really caught up on a task that feels hard but not impossible to accomplish. so days or a couple weeks pass with me buried in this task. i'm getting better at recognizing when i'm in this kind of rut, and stopping to ask for team input on how i could do things. it's also a reason why i benefit from being a team setting, because then someone can call me out on it and suggest a better path.

I am pretty proactive in terms of my work, I've talk about how I sort of motivate myself to learn how to program for game development, software engineering is truly where my passion lies, Coding acts like a medium between my mind and the real world. It really cool to be able to actualize my ideas. I'd say very adaptable, take the extra mile to learn stuff.

watched a youtube vlog for pcc swe intern, she said we interns are treated as fulltime employees.
Genuinely want to work at PCC, saw the posts on linkedin for coop students, inclusive
Want to make it a memorable experience, have a story to talk about

Thanks for interviewing me. It's my first coop interview and I'm a bit nervous. So if I seem nervous, it's because I really am. Try my best to give my 100%

"[Students] bring new ideas, they bring creativity, and they bring fresh perspective to our teams. From an employer perspective, it also gives us the opportunity to evaluate a full‐time employee before we commit to hiring them. It gives us access to a diverse talent pool of highly motivated students.”

I am genuinely interested in working at PointClickCare, I rly love the idea of digializing an industry. "I'm really excited about this position and think I'm able to do an exceptional job at it. If there is anything I can do or discuss to help with my chances. I'd love to talk about it

#### Why companies take interns?

1. For many companies it is a part of "community relations". Having these ties to local universities gives some clout with government when they want something.
2. Marketing
3. gets your name out there and hopefully they had a good experience and tell their friends.
4. Have interns do the grunt work that full timers dont have time to do
