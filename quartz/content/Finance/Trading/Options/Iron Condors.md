### Choosing Iron Condor Wings

> When determining our condor wings, there is a systematic way of doing it.

1. Price our [[Straddle]]
	- Let's say we decided to sell a $20 put and a $20 call -> -$3
2. Determine Conviction
	- Finding out the probability of price exceeding our [[Straddle]] to determine the spread of the wing
3. 1 or 2 Standard Deviation
	 -  **$20 +- Price of Straddle**, so $17 and $23, if we are doing a earnings trade, expand it to 2 times the Price of Straddle
