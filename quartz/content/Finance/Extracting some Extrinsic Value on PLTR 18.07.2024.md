I found out it's **favorable** to squeeze out some [[Extrinsic Value]] on PLTR, in other words, shorting the volatility few days before their earnings report release.


#### Why is it a Good Time Now

If we look at the [[Implied Volatility]] of PLTR on 2024-08-02, the current IV is around **7%** more than the historic volatility. Which means that the option contracts expiring on Aug 2nd are overpriced. I am not sure how exactly comparing IV and HV can find out whether an option contract is overvalued or undervalued, but it is what it is.


#### Institutional Protection

We can see on Aug 2nd, there are both a spike on put and call open interests, of which are at **22.5** and **30** respectively. That means if PLTR blew past $30 a share by the expiration date. Hedge funds are gonna be paying up lot of money to wallstreetbets degenerates. Same thing around if the price drops below $22.5. So that's what I meant by *Institutional Protection*, the big money in the market is in our favor. (Kinda)


#### Technical Analysis

Now I know technical analysis don't fucking matter, so does my life. But here the red horizontal lines represents the potential trade we're going to take. Like I said above we are shorting volatility. So as long as until Aug 2nd PLTR stays between $22.50 and $30.00 we are good. Viewing from this TA we can see PLTR broke the upward channel few weeks ago, also, just 2 weeks ago it even broke a strong resistance at $27.05 as seen on the grey line. Overall it is bullish. I believe PLTR in the next 2 weeks will retest the resistance, possibly dropping below $27.00. Rising above $30.00 is unlikely as explained above in the call open interests. 


#### Choosing Iron Condor over Short Straddle

A Short Straddle provides zero upside and downside protection

If we look at the chart from optionsprofitcalculator.com, you can see until expiry as long as PLTR stays between $22.50 and $30.00, we are taking a profit of $70, BUT, with unlimited risk, that's crazy. So we are not placing this trade. Instead take a look at the Iron Condor I've made.

![[Pasted image 20240719141438.png]]

Now with a maximum risk of $115, that is if PLTR rise above $31.50, and if PLTR drops below $22.50, we are only losing $15 max no matter how much it dropped. So, that's 30.4% return on this trade (741% annual return)

Adding both of these risks we are earning $35, now you might ask, I could have earned $75 in the first place if I did a short straddle! Well then just double down on the Iron Conder and buy 2 contracts. Now you'd be risking $230 to earn $70. As opposed to you could be losing an unpredictable amount of money if it's OTM on expiry.

In summary, buy and sell a put at $22 and $22.5, buy and sell a call at $31.5 and $30. In total these 4 legs should net us $35 per contract.

TL;DR: Iron Condor on PLTR placed on 2024-07-18, if PLTR stays between $22.50 and $30.00 by 2024-08-02, I will be profiting $35 per contract, with a upward risk of $115.
