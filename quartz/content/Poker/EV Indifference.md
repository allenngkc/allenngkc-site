The word "indifference" means that two or more actions have the same value

### The Law of Selfish EV

No hand should sacrifice value to improve the value of the rest of your range. A perfect strategy always takes the highest EV action with each hand in every spot

- The consequence of Law 1 is Law 2: The Law of Selfish EV implies the Law of Indifference

### The Law of indifference

If a hand mixes multiple actions, those actions will have the same value, Ex: if a hand mixes between calls and folds, then calling must be worth 0 EV. If a nutted hand mixes between calling and raising, then trapping must be worth as much as fast-playing

> [!tip] If calling is worth $3 and raising is worth $3, then you must be indifferent between calling and raising.


#### Leveraging the Law of Indifference

Forcing your opponent into facing indifferent decisions can be benetfical.

### The Law of Fixed Strategies

Changing mixtures between indifferent actions cannot lose value against a fixed strategy. Mixing can only be exploited if the opposition adapts their strategy
