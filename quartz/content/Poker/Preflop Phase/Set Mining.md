When you call a pre-flop raise with the primary intention of flopping a set with a small pocket pair such as 22-55

> Often disguised and likely to get paid off against strong hands such as JJ+ and AQ+ when our opponents flop top pair or an over-pair

**The odds of flopping a set or better is 11.76%*** or 7.5:1 odds
> Make sure that during one time we do, we make enough money to make up for the other 7.5 times we don't flop a set

8:1, we need to be able to make back all the money in once


#### 15-to-1 Rule

For every 1bb we invest, we should expect a return of 15bb, if we risk 3bb to set mine every time, we want 45bb in return every time we flop a set
