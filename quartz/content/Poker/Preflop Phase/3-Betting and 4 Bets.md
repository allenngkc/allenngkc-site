##### There are two primary reasons for 3-betting

1. For Value: Expect to get called by worse hands when we 3-bet (AA, KK) Too good to call
2. Bluff: When we have a hand that is too bad to call, we expect our opponent to fold


### 3-Betting for Value

When we're 3-betting for value, our primary consideration is our opponent's open-raising range

>When we 3-bet for value, we want our value range to be stronger than our opponent's open-raising range

Use the following table when going against a specific position open raise

| Versus     |     | 3-Bet Value Range                                   |     | 3-Bet Equity vs. Raising Range |     |
| ---------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------- | --- | ------------------------------ | --- |
| UTG 9.80%  |     | Default: AA-KK, AKs<br>Optional: AKo, QQ            |     | 65.68% Equity                  |     |
| MP 12.67%  |     | Default: AA-QQ, AKs<br>Optional: JJ, AKo, AQs       |     | 65.16% Equity                  |     |
| CO 22.17%  |     | Default: AA-JJ, AQ+, AJs<br>Optional: AJo, ATs, KQs |     | 67.32% Equity                  |     |
| BTN 35.44% |     | Default: AA-JJ, AQ+, AJs<br>Optional: AJo, ATs, KQs |     | 61.97% Equity                  |     |
| SB 22.17%  |     | Default: AA-TT, AJ+<br>Optional: KQs, ATs           |     | 64.79% Equity                  |     |

>[!tip] If we have a positional unaware opponent, observe their PFR stat and adjust your 3-bet value range accordingly 

### 3-Betting As a Bluff

 In general, a 3-bet bluff needs to work approximately 2/3 of the time to be break even.

3-Bet Bluff Break Even Percentage: x

$$x = Risk/(Risk+Reward)
$$
**Risk: Your 3-Bet Bluff Amount
Reward: Amount of Money in Pot Before bluff**

Sample calculations:
- Opponent has open raised to 3bb and there is 1.5bb in the pot (from SB and BB)

1. 2.8x Sizing: 65.1% Breakeven Point
2. 3x Sizing: 66.7 Breakeven Point
3. 3.5x Sizing: 70% Breakeven Point

> Thus, ideally a 3-Bet bluff needs to work 70% - 75% of the time including rake

##### Why 3-Bet Bluff?

1. Balancing our Range, include 3-bet bluffs to enhance the likelihood of getting paid off, also make us less exploitable

3.  High Fold Equity: When observing our opponent [[Hud Stats]], look for opponent with very high Fv3Bet stat. **ideally over 70%**

##### Good 3-Bet Bluffing Hands

- Not all mediocre starting hands are good 3-Bet Bluffing Hands

1. Blocker Hands (Ax, Kx, Qx, Jx)
2. Suited Hands
3. Suited Connectors
4. Small Pocket Pairs
 
### Don't 3-bet bluffing to often in Micro Stakes!
- Opponents' inability to fold 3-bets (Loose Passive Players)

> One important consideration when 3-bet bluffing is how often we expect our opponents to fold, [[Fold Equity]]

#### 3-Bet Progression at the Micro Stakes
- Begin with strong depolarized 3-betting until we're comfortable playing in 3-bet pots and understand post-flop
- Then Begin using a depolarized range with few of the better bluffing hands


### Default 3-Bet Sizing

Regardless for value or as a bluff

##### Out of Position: 3.5x our opponent's open-raise sizing
##### In Position: 3x our opponent's open-raise sizing

> We bet more when out of position because it's harder to realize our equity when we're out of position, so we want them to fold pre-flop


### Defending Against Depolarized 3-Bets

**If it's behind**: We should fold, QJs vs. a 3-betting range of QQ+ and AKs

**It's it's ahead**: We should 4-bet for value. KK vs. a 3-betting range of QQ+ and AKs

**Not Sure**: We should consider calling, JJ versus a 3-betting range of QQ+ and AKs

### Defending Against Polarized 3-Bets

- For tougher opponents, they will be more apt to 3-betting a polarized range with bluffs

- Easiest way to identify if someone is 3-betting a polarized 3-betting range is 3bet % in [[Hud Stats]]

1. 5% of Less: Most likely depolarized 3-betting range
2. 6-7%: Potentially polarized, but possibly depolarized
3. 8%+: Most likely polarized range

> When facing an aggressive 3-bettor:

1. Tighten Up Our Open-Raising Range
2. Raise a Smaller Sizing from the CO & BTN
3. Defend a Wider Range
4. Find a New Table

### Reacting to 4-Bets

 We should consider our opponent's 4-betting range

> Options are 3-bet/fold, 3-bet/call, 5-bet/all-in

> Most of the time, your opponent is only 4-betting a strong value range of KK+, **You should fold hands such as JJ-QQ**, but if he is capable of 4-betting with a polarized range, you should consider calling or 5-bet jamming all in preflop with hands such as JJ-QQ
