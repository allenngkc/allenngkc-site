A pre-flop raise that occurs after an opponent limps with the intention to isolate the limper in a heads-up pot post-flop or win the hand pre-flop

### One of the most powerful thing in Micro Stakes

##### We want to play against one limper
##### The more limpers there are in a hand, the stronger a hand we should isolation raise

#### Why we Iso-Raise
- Typically only weaker opponents will be open-limping at the micro stakes.

1. Open-Limp: The first person to voluntarily enter t he pot by limping for 1bb rather than raising.
2. Limp Behind: To limp in pre-flop for 1bb after one or more players have already done so

1. It increases the number of hands we play against weaker opponents in heads-up situations
2. It helps us avoid multi-way hands where our equity is diminished
3. Capitalize on weaker opponents post flop mistakes
4. Winning the pot pre-flop

##### Weak-Tight Limper
- VPIP/PFR: 15/6
- VPIP/PFR: 13/5
##### Weak-Loose Limper
- VPIP/PFR: 50/8
- VPIP/PFR: 42/6

### Default Isolation Raise Sizing

##### **Size: 3bb raise + 1bb per limper + 1b if out of position**

##### Exploitative Raise Sizing Adjustments
- Raise Larger when several limpers that hate to fold
- Raise Less when short stackers with lower equity
- Raise Larger with higher equity hands 

>[!tip] When we're out of position, we should iso-raise a stronger range to help compensate for our positional disadvantage, especially for Weak-Loose Limpers


>[!tip] When we're in position, we can look to expand our iso-raising range, especially against weak-tight opponents who have a tendency to fold too much
