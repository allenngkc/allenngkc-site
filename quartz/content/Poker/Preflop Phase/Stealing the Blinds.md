Raising first in an unopened pot pre-flop from the CO, BTN or SB position to steal the blinds, trying to win 1.5BB 

#### We don't want action
- When we look at how wide our CO, BTN and SB open raising range, we only want action with our strongest hands

> While we're not worried about our opponents playing back against us with our good starting hands, we prefer to take down the blinds in a relatively painless fashion like K7s and T7o
#### Blind Steal Mathematics
- Typically we are risking 2bb - 3bb to win 1.5bb

- Blind Steal Break Even Percentage: Risk / (Risk + Reward)
- 3bb Steal: 3bb / (3bb + 1.5bb) = 66.7% Breakeven Point+1.
- 2.5bb Steal: 2.5bb / (2.5bb 5bb) = 62.5% Breakeven Point
- 2bb Steal: 2bb / (2bb + 1.5bb) = 57.1% Breakeven Point 

**When our opponents don't fold, we need to take potential pre-flop and post-flop actions and scenarios into consideration**
1. Our opponents' Overall Playing Style
2. Our opponents' Blind Defense Propensity
3. Our opponents' Post Flop Tendencies
