> Remember, we expect to lose money in the blinds, meaning playing from the blinds is **-EV**

##### Our goal with blind defense is to minimize our losses

| Steal Size | SB Pot Odds | BB Pot Odds When SB Calls | BB Pot Odds When SB Folds |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 2bb        | 30.00%      | 16.67%                    | 22.22%                    |
| 2.5bb      | 33.33%      | 20.00%                    | 27.27%                    |
| 3bb        | 35.71%      | 22.22%                    | 30.77%                    |
- If we're being offered, for example, 33% pot odds, theoretically we only need 33% of greater equity to call that bet.

>[!tip] When facing a steal attempt from the blinds, note that our opponents are opening a wide range of hands

##### Defending from the SB is much more treacherous than defending from the BB
- SB has to worry about how BB will react to a call or 3-bet squeeze because SB isn't closing the action
- If SB calls a CO or BTN steal attempt, BB can 3-bet as a [[Squeeze Play]]
- Furthermore, if SB 3-bet bluffs frequently, BB can attempt to resteal by a 4-bet
