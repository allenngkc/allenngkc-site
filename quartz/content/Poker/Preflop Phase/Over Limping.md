To limp in pre-flop for 1bb after one or more players have already done so

>[!tip] While it's not as profitable as [[Isolation Raising Limpers]]], it is a viable strategy in the right situation

#### Reason to not over-limp
- If there's an aggressive opponent left to act that has shown a propensity to iso-raise frequently versus limpers

- "Are they likely to iso-raise us?"

#### Reasons to Over Limp
- We have a weaker implied odds hand that plays well in multi-way pots.
- There are multiple limpers in the pot and we have very little [[Fold Equity]]
- Effective stack sizes are shallow and passive players on the table left to act
