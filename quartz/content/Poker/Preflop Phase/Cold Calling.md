Calling a raise after there has been a bet and one or more raise. When a player raises pre-flop and another calls. **Cold Call**


#### The Gap Concept
You need a stronger hand to call a raise than to make a raise yourself. We should call with hands that play well against our opponent's perceived open-raising range.

**But not good enough to 3-bet for value**

> We should also fold hands that we believe are dominated by our opponent's opening range

#### Cold-Calling Considerations
- Equity Edge
- Good Implied Odds
- Post-Flop Playability Edge
- Open-Raise Bet Sizing
- Player's Left to Act 

##### Equity Edge

The following are gap concept hands:

| Our Hand | Our Equity | Villain's UTG 12% Range         | Villain's Equity | Action |     |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | --- |
| AQs      | 53.29%     | 66+, ATs+, KJs+, JTs, AJo+, KQo | 46.71%           | Call   |     |
| KTs      | 41.51%     | 66+, ATs+, KJs+, JTs, AJo+, KQo | 58.49%           | Fold   |     |

##### Good implied Odds

- We out-flop our opponents
- Having deep effective stack sizes, 150bb+, can be more speculative
- There are bad recreational players left to act
- Weaker hands like suited connectors, suited one-gappers, small pocket pairs, Ax

##### Post-Flop Playability Edge

If we suspect open-raiser is opening a wide range pre-flop, we can cold-call with a wider range of hands to outplay our opponents post-flop

> Where post-flop skills comes to play


##### Players Left to Act

- The more players there are left to act, the more conservative our cold-calling range should be

>The more players left, the greater the probability that one of our opponents will wake up with a premium strength hand or 3-bet squeeze us out of the hand
