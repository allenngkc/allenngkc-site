To make a large raise after there has already been one raise and at least one call

Nothing more than a [[3-Betting and 4 Bets]], but with different intentions

- People will often use this strategy when they sense the open-raiser is opening a weaker, wider range.

> Squeezer knows the open-raiser will be less inclined to call their re-raise because of their ranges, but also knows the person who [[Cold Calling]] will often have a weak, capped range


#### Why we don't bluff squeeze

> Squeeze bluffing is not encouraged

>[!tip] Not necessary at the lower micro stakes! Cause less inclined to fold to 3-bets!

#### Value Squeeze
Same same a depolarized 3-betting range in [[3-Betting and 4 Bets]]

- Open-Raiser: Open-Raising Range, 3-Bet Calling Range, and 4-Betting Range
- Cold-Caller: Calling Range(s)

##### Purpose of value squeezing
1. Build the pot with a premium 3-betting hand
2. Win the pot uncontested pre-flop

#### Value Squeeze Play Range

| Versus         | 3-Bet Value Range                                |     |     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --- | --- |
| UTG Open Raise | Default: AA-KK, AKs, Optional: AKo, QQ           |     |     |
| MP Open Raise  | Default: AA-QQ, AKs Optional: JJ, AKo, AQs       |     |     |
| CO Open Raise  | Default: AA-JJ. AQ+, AJs Optional: AJo, ATs, KQs |     |     |
| BTN Open Raise | Default: AA-JJ, AQ+, AJs Optional: AJo, ATs, KQs |     |     |

#### Squeeze Play Sizing

- Our squeeze play sizing will be similar to our 3-bet sizing, but now we also have to account for each caller in the hand. Generally, +3bb per caller:

1. Out of Position: 3.5x open raise sizing + 3bb per caller
2. In Position: 3x open raise sizing + 3bb per caller
