When we are playing with our card ranges, we often adjust our sizing based on how our opponent plays

### Hud Stats (Session Stats)

One of the reliable ways to observe how our opponent plays is the hud stats
> Aim to observe numbers with 40+ hands

Ideal VPIP range: 15% - 35%
Ideal PFR range: Little below VPIP (> 5%)

Large VPIP, PFR difference = Passive, Fishy potential
VPIP larger than 35% = Loose, Fishy potential

> To be safer, keep an eye out for stats like 90/4 (Super Passive). 60/40 (Loose Aggressive)
