### Argressor
1. Giving up way too less after high frequency c-bet -> Overbluffing
2. Brainlessly betting 50% pot
3.  Bet turn bet river
4. Raise for test
5. Slow play top range
6. Overbluffing calling stations

### Defender
1. Not enough check raise
2. X/R on draw & two pair+
3. High frequency barrel off after X/R
4. Check range imbalance
5. X/C flop, X/R turn always NUTS

### Suggestions
1. vs extreme line -> overfold
2. vs low stakes -> less bluff / more value bet
3. vs cap range -> bluff size up if we have nuts/range advantage
4. In low stakes X/B/B, B/X/B will always be medium hand
5. Do not overplay blocker
6. check to river -> bluff more. 75%
