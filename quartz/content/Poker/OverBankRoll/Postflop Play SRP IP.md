### QT2r
### Turn Play

#### Brick $\implies$ Overbet
- Nuts advantage but range disadvantage
- We want to attack their range with our top range
#### IP -> Nuts disadvantage but Range Advantage $\implies$ 75% Bet
- Completing Straights 

#### Same Cards $\implies$ Lower Betting Frequency and Small Bets

#### AK7r
- We want to use our nut advantage

- 9-2 (Except 7) -> IP remains nut advantage
- QJT -> Completed Straight, IP more strong hands and high equity bluff
- Same Cards AK7 -> Reduce IP strong hands combo, helps OOP
