#### 3B Pot IP Raiser Range Checking

On low connected board and straight boards (4-8), OOP should be donking their range, if not  we can exploit by range checking on flop

#### 3B Pot IP Raiser Range Betting

IP should cbet often, monotone bet 50% of the time

- Villain tends to defend 3bet too much, postflop overflod
- Villain not enough check raise

preferably do 1/4 cbets


#### 3B Bet OOP Raiser Donking

We can lower our bet size to simplify our stratregy while minimizing our EV loss 

Dry board $\implies$ Higher Bet Size
Wet board $\implies$ Lower Bet Size

Monotone Board / 3 Head Card -> Bet 10%
Villain many overcard / Dry -> Bet 50%

Less overcard / Wet board -> Bet 20%


### 3 Bet Exploit

Regs tend to call 3 bet too much, so they won't defend enough c-bets and delayed bets, river bets
we can exploit by c-betting more
