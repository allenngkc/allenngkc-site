 We observed on GTOW that BB will often overfold to flop c-bets according to [[Minimum Defense Frequency]]

#### BB Facing Different Open SIzes
| Open SIze | Pot Odds |
| --------- | -------- |
| 5bb       | 0.38     |
| 3bb       | 0.30     |
| 2.5bb     | 0.27     |
| 2.2bb     | 0.24     |
| 2bb       | 0.22     |

#### Why is that?
1. Preflop pot odds
2. Opening range too weak
3. Very hard to realize our equity (No position)

#### Example Situations

#### vs 33% (BTN vs BB J73r)
1. Any flop pair
2. Any pocket pairs
3. Any gutshots, open ended straight draws
4. Overcards backdoor flush, backdoor straights
5. Good Ax 

#### vs 75% (BTN vs BB J73r)
1.  Any flop pair
2.  Stronger pocket pairs
3. Any gutshots and open ended straight draws
4. Only good overcards + backdoor flush + backdoor straights

#### vs 125% (BTN vs BB J73r)
1. Any flop pair
2. Only 99+
3. Almost all gutshots and open ended straight draws
