#### Bet Size & Frequency

Range advantage $\implies$ Higher Bet Size, Higher betting frequency

Betting Range Wider $\implies$ Higher betting frequency $\implies$ Smaller Bet Sizes
Betting Range Tighter $\implies$ Lower betting frequency $\implies$ Higher Bet Sizes (Polarized) **(Representing Nuts or Nothing)**


### VS Bet

Facing higher bet sizes $\implies$ Less defending frequency $\implies$ Tighter Range
Facing lower bet sizes $\implies$ More defending frequency $\implies$ Wider Range  


Range Advantage + Nut Advantage $\implies$ Size doesn't matter
#### Range Advantage + Nut Disadvantage $\implies$ Bet small
- We are giving away blinds to villain's nuts
- We are isolating our medium-strong hands into villain's nuts range
- We are giving better SPR ratio to xr flop and deny our equity on turn [[Stack to Pot Ratios (SPRs)]]


### Charging Draws

**Big Size**
- If villain's calling range is flexible
- When we have nut advantage

**Small Size**
- When villain is protected by nuts range

### Deny Equity
- Attacking villain's folding range

**Small Size**
- When we have range advantage
- When our value range need to be protected (When Villain have more overcards)
- When villain have nuts advantage

**Big Size**
- When we don't have range advantage but nuts advantage

### Questions To Ask on Flop

1. Who has Range/Nut Advantage?
2. Villain's Range Equity
3. Villain's Calling Range Flexibility

>[!tip] Think about villain's calling range flexibility to determine flop c-bet frequency and sizes

#### Priority Thinking
1. Nut Advantage
2. Calling Range Flexibility


> [!tip] We can cause difficulty in defending for villain if they range is not balanced after flop using bet sizes, make them uncomfortable
