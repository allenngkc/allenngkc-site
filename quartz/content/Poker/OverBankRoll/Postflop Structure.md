##### Things to Consider
- Range advantage
- Nut advantage (two pair, or offsuit combos)
- Nut on river
- Opponent Equity
- Opponent Draws


### BTN vs BB SRP 100BB Deep

#### Board AK7r -> big size bet (150%)
- Opponents no overcards (no need to deny equity)
- Attack their gutshots
- Use our nut advantage
##### Street Value Combo

Three Streets Value (36~100bb) -> AQ, AK, Set
Two Streets Value (6~35bb) -> A6 ~ AJ
One Street Value (1~5bb) -> KJ, KQ, A2, A3
Showdown Value -> QJ, 22~QQ, 7x

##### Why we bluff 22, 33, 44
- Going to showdown will let opponent to realize their equity
- Can hit set, also not obvious (Since we bet on flop)
##### Why we bluff 7x
- Blocking opponents calling range (77, !7, K7)
- Have growth
##### Why not bluff 88
- Bluffing 22 with 88 have no purpose
- Less overcards, no need to deny equity\
- More showdown value, win 66, 55, 44 

#### Board QT2r -> range c-bet (33%)
- Range and Nut advantage
- Deny equity, charge draw

Range c-bet implies the choice between
b/b/x or b/x/b

##### B/B/X
1. Not need to face opponent raise on river
2. Guarantee two streets of value
##### B/X/B
1. Protect our checking range
2. If our turn check aren't enough, opponent will bet more on river
3. Let one street value and showdown value hands go to showdown

High check frequency on turn, or large bets on turn to polar
Balance bluff in every line in a range c-bet strategy

#### Board 982r -> C-Bet 75%
- Nut advantage
- Deny equity and charge opponent draw
##### Street Value Combo

Three Streets Value -> QQ KK AA two pair +
Two Streets Value -> 9x TT JJ
One Street Value -> 2x, 8x
Showdown Value -> AK AQ, small pairs    

##### Why we c-bet on one/two street value hands?  
- Nut advantage
- Deny equity and charge opponent draw
- **Obtain value early**

#### Board 642r -> Mixed Stratregy

Bet K3 not KQ, Since K3 has nut advantage
Bet 56s not AA, Since 56s needs more protection

Lots of draws and equity hands for opponent
- If we bet on flop, higher chance of getting raised on flop

66~88 more lower range hands need protection, AA, KK does not, so check morex
