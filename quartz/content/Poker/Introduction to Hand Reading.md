- Determining our relative hand strength requires that we be able to hand read effectively

Read [[Type of Hands]]
#### What Head Reading Isn't
1. It's not the ability to read our opponent's souls and put them on a specific hand
2. Not a process of trying to assign our opponent one specific hand

> It's a deductive process of assigning our opponent's logical ranges based on their pre-flop actions and then further refining and narrowing those ranges based on their **post-flop actions**

#### Hand Reading Factors
- Opponent's Pre-Flop Actions
- Opponent's Playing Styles and Tendencies
- Post-Flop Board Texture and Actions
- Turn and River Card Run Outs
