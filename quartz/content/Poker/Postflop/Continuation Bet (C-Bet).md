When a player who bet our raised in the prior round of betting bets again during the current round of betting

##### Flop C-Bet
When the pre-flop raiser continues with a bet on the flop
##### Turn C-Bet
When the flop c-bettor continues with a second c-bet on the turn
##### River C-Bet
When the turn c-bettor continues with third c-bet on the river


#### Delayed C-Betting
if we decide to not c-bet the flop and then c-bet the turn or river, this is consider a delayed c-bet.

Reasons:
1. Slow Play/Induce
2. Pot Control
3. Bluff

##### Slow Play/Induce

- We can employ a slow playing strategy when we have a monster value hand that has the board crushed.
- We **under represent the strength** of our hand and induce our opponent to bluff
- Other times, we allow our opponents to improve their hand on the turn **that will be more likely to call a delayed c-bet than a flop c-bet**

##### Pot Control

- When we have a weaker value hand, medium strength hand. That isn't always strong enough to c-bet the flop but is sometimes the best hand.
- The goal of pot control is to **limit the size of the pot** and get to showdown cheaply
- We employ a delayed c-bet on the turn or river to extract thin value from our opponents

##### Bluff
- When we have a weak hand that isn't strong to bet on the flop, we can employ a delayed c-bet as a bluff
- When our opponents check back twice, they typically don't have a hand they seem strong enough to call a bet
- **Checking back twice is a general sign of weakness** at the micro stakes.

#### Factors for C-Betting
1. Board Texture
2. Relative Hand Strength
3. Number of Opponents
4. Position
5. Equity
6. Vulnerability of Hand
7. Barrel Potential
8.  Stack Sizes
9. Opponent's Playing Style

#### When Not to C-Bet

###### Garbage Hand
- Unless our opponents have a very high fold to c-bet percentage or are checking back multiple street and not fighting for the pot, we shouldn't c-bet
- Very low fold equity, no reason to try to bluff our opponents out of a hand

###### Really Weak Draw
- When we have a really weak draw that has very little equity to improve

###### Non-Vulnerable Value Hand
- Whenever we flop a monster value hand that is invulnerable to any turn cards, we should consider checking, given that our opponents' hand would not be strong enough to call a flop c-bet

#### C-Betting Strong Value Hands
- Strong Value hands can be c-bet for either
1. 1 street of value: Top Pair with Good Kicker
2. 2 streets of value: strong value <-> Medium-Strength
3. 3 streets of value: strong flushes, sets, two pair, etc

#### C-Betting Weak Hands
- Weaker opponent's at the micro stakes have a tendency to call to mumch, so bluffing too much can be -EV
- However, we can bluff our weakest hands, when our opponents have high fold to c-bet stat
- Nobody is fighting for dead money in the pot
