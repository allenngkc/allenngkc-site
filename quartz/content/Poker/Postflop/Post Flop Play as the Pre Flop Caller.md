Playing post-flop as the pre-flop caller is much different than as the pre-flop aggressor because we'll rarely have the initiative and we'll also have a capped range.

##### Capped Range
- A pre-flop range of starting hands that has a celling to it, which typically doesn't include exceptionally strong starting hands

#### Post-Flop Caller Factors
1. Pre-Flop Aggressor's Preceived Hand Strength
2. The Board Texture & Vulnerability of Our Hand
3. Opponent Playing Style, Tendencies, C-Betting Frequency
4. Our Relative Hand Strength
5. Number of Opponents
6. Our Position
7. Our Equity
8. Effective Stack Sizes

##### Pre Flop Aggressor's Perceived Hand Strength
- Putting the preflop raiser on a range of hands is essential to understanding how well the preflop raiser' open-raising range connects with the post-flop board texture
- Preflop raiser's c-betting frequency gives us an idea of that person's perceived hand strength


#### The One Third Rule
You will flop a strong value hand approximately 33% of the time.

> C-Betting frequency tells us how strong our opponent's hand is 

| C-Bet Stat | Hand Strength Interpretation                                |     |     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| 0 - 33%    | Strong Value Hand                                           |     |     |
| 34 - 50%   | Strong to Weak Value Hand, Potential Bluffs and Semi Bluffs |     |     |
| 51%+       | Value Hands, Bluffs & Semi-Bluffs                           |     |     |

### Strong Value Hands Strategy

- As the preflop caller, our strategy is based on our relative hand strength
- We must consider we're ahead or behind the preflop raiser's range

###### Board Texture & Vulnerability of Our Hand

1. If our hand is vulnerable to draws, there's a necessity to fast play it
2. If our hand is relatively invulnerable, no need to fast play it

###### Wet Board Textures

1. Out of Position: We should consider leading out as a donk bet rather than looking to take a check/raise line with our very strong value hands

2. In Position: We should consider raising a flop bet

> In general, you want to fast-play wet boards

###### Dry Board Textures

1. There is no necessity to fast play our strong value hands, cause ideally we want weaker value hands and bluffs player to keep them.

- With Top Pair Hands, we'll typically look to call two or three streets of c-bets
- With Two Pair or better Hands, we'll often call the flop and look to raise the turn or river.
- If preflop raiser checks, sometimes we bet for value, or employ delay c-bet the turn

### Medium Strength Hands Strategy

- Looking to chem them down for their solid showdown value
- Mainly we check/fold

> Against opponents who likes to bluff, we are more inclined to call few street of bets
> Against opponents who are straight forward, we are more inclined to fold


### Drawing Hand Strategy

Can we call: Three Simple Steps
1. We determine our pot odds and implied odds
2. We determine our equity in the hand using the Rule of 2 and 4
3. We compare our pot and implied odds with our equity to determine if calling is +EV or -EV


### Weak Hands Strategy

##### Out of Position
- We'll typically play our weak hands straightforward by check/folding to c-bets from the pre-flop raiser
##### In Position
- Against tighter, straightforward opponents with a perceived strong range and low c-betting frequency, we fold our weak hands to a c-bet
- Against opponents with a perceived weak range and a high c-betting frequency, we can look to potentially float the flop and bluff the turn
- And when the preflop raiser checks the flop, we can sometimes bluff the flop
