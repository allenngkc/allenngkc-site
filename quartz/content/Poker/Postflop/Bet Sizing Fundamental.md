##### 3 Specific Goals to bet:
1. Extract maximum value with our made hands
2. To deny our opponents the ability to easily realize their equity with drawing hands
3. To bluff as cheaply as possible


#### Our Bets = Opponent's Pot Odds
- Whenever we bet, we're offering our opponents a gambling wager
- Our bet offers our opponents a specific pot odds price to call
- On wet board textures, our goal is to offer our opponents **-EV** pot odds price to call

| Bet Size          | Pot Odds Ratio | Pot Odds Percentage |     |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --- |
| 1/2 Pot-Sized Bet | 3:1 Pot Odds   | 25% Pot Odds        |     |
| 2/3 Pot-Sized Bet | 2.5:1 Pot Odds | 28.5% Pot Odds      |     |
| 3/4 Pot-Sized Bet | 2.3:1 Pot Odds | 30.3% Pot Odds      |     |
| Pot-Sized Bet     | 2:1 Pot Odds   | 33.3% Pot Odds      |     |
#### Recommended Bet Sizing: 3/4 Pot Sized bet for microstakes

##### Exploits Inelastic Tendencies
- Bad recreational players will call larger bets with the same range of hands

##### Denies Drawing Hand Equity
- Assuming wet board textures, a 3/4 pot-sized bet provides all but monster draws with 15 outs a bad pot odds price to call
- When betting 3/4 pot-sized bet, we're offering our opponents a 30.3% pot odds price to call
- Many draws that will call are likely to have 8.5% to 25.5% drawing hand equity, which is a -EV call
