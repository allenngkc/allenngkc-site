### Bet for Value

**Getting worse hands to call**

> Betting the best hand != betting for value
> Consider the likelihood of opponents calling with worse hands - **not fold!**

Betting the best hand + likely to get called by worse hand = value bet

1. Strong Value: Unlikely to be beaten
2. Medium Value: Expect to be ahead 60% of the time
3. Thin Value: Mediocre Hands, get opponents to pay us off with even weaker hands
### Bluff / Semi-Bluff

1. Pure Bluff: Betting / Raise that has little chance of improving. Fold their hand
>[[Fold Equity]]: Percentage of time we expect opponents to fold

>[!tip] Pure Bluff is ineffective in Micro Stakes!

##### Bluff Bet Sizing

###### Post-Flop Bet Sizes:

1/2 Pot Sized Bluff: 33% -> Break Even 
3/4 Pot Sized Bluff: 43% -> Break Even
1 Pot Sized Bluff: 50% -> Break Even

>Doesn't mean you should always bluff smaller!
>But aim to bluff less and max their fold chance

>[!tip] Notice that it doesn't need to work that often

#### Semi Bluff

**Fold Equity + Drawing Hand Equity = Semi Bluff**

Purpose is twofold
1. Get them to fold
2. Build the pot when we hit our draw
