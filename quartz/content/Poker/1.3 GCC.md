### Player Pool (Generally weak and passive)
1. Underbluff
2. Not enough check raise
3. Overplay medium hands
4. Not 3-Betting enough

overfold
attack their checking range
- c-bet small size to exploit (as not enough flop raise)
overfold their turn bet, overbluff their turn check 
let them make decision (id strong weak range, no need to make them fold)
bluff in optimal spots


dont play too much hands cause high rake

### My play
- Too passive
- slow play too much
- we should be more aggressive
- should id their bluff combos when catching or overfolding
