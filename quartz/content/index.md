### Hi, I'm Allen Ng

I am a Systems Design Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo, this is where I store all my notes mostly about poker, competitive programming, SWE and math!

### What is Conceptual Note Taking?

Unlike traditional note-taking methods, where I find it hard to retrieve information over a series of sequential notes. Conceptual note taking helps structure loosely organized notes. [How to achieve more while studying less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms) This video and a good friend of mine in high school inspired me to start using obsidian since 2023.

>[!tip] Though I don't have a strict system of writing the notes, I try to keep them organized and worthy for information retrieval. In the future, I aim to include finance, philosophy topics here as well.
