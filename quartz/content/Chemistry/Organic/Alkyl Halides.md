Sometimes substituent includes halogens, such as chlorine, or fluorine

Below are namings
$-F=fluoro$
$-Cl = chloro$
$-Br = bromo$
$-I = Iodo$

> The boiling and melting points of alkyl halides are higher than normal alkanes, since halogens are much more electronegative than $C$ and $H$, they attract electrons, pulling them away from carbon atoms. Making it **polar**. The resulting polarity increases the strength of intermolecular forces.
