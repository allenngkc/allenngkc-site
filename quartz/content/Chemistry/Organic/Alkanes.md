An organic compound is a molecular compound containing carbon with the exception of carbon monoxide, $CO$, $CO_{2}$, and hydrogen cyanide $HCH$

##### Hydrocarbons

whose molecules consist only carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms connect by [[Covalent Bonds]]

> Natural gas, gasoline, fuel oil, diesel fuel

however, burning carbon-based fuels contributes to global warming

##### Saturated Hydrocarbons

aka **alkane**, is a hydrocarbon in which all bonds with carbon are single bonds. $CH_{4}$ is an example:

![[screenshot_CH4.png|150]]

##### General Formula
for an alkane is 
$$C_{n}H_{2n+2}$$

we have the following table and namings

Refer to [[Representing Organic Compounds]] for more ways to express a alkane.

>"Monkey Eat Peel Bananas" (1-4) (Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane)

##### Cyclic Alkane

a hydrocarbon where carbon atoms form a closed loop instead of a chain, the formula for cyclic alkane is 
$$C_{n}H_{2n}$$

#### Substituent Group

any atom or group that replace hydrogen in an organic molecule (side group / branches)

The [[Alkyl Group]], [[Alkyl Halides]] are types of substituent group

##### Structural Isomerism

Most hydrocarbon with 4 or more carbon atoms exhibits structural isomerism.
> Take $C_{4}H_{10}$ as an example. there are 2 alkanes with the same formula

> in b) we see that it has a total of 4 carbon, however, the top carbon is a branched hydrocarbon off from the main chain. Therefore it's **methylpropane**

As they have different structures, we exhibits different properties

#### Naming Organic Compounds

1. Determine the parent chain, Identify the longest carbon chain
2. Identify all of the groups (Substituents) attached to the parent chain
3. Name the parent chain (drop e to add suffix)
> Number the substituents attached to carbon with the **lowest possible number**, if tied, order **alphabetically**
4. If the same substituent is present more than once, use prefix to indicate (di-,tri-,tetra-)
5. List substituents in alphabetical order, separate words by hyphens, separate numbers by commas, use simplest possible arrangement

$6-butan-2-yl-3-ethyl-8-methyldecane$

#### Properties of Alkanes

Alkanes exhibits relatively low boiling and melting points

Carbon and hydrogen have similar electronegativities, this means the bonds are close to non-polar, weak Van der Waals forces are the main intermolecular force in hydrocarbon compounds

 > as the chain gets longer, the boiling point gets higher

###### Fractional Distillation

A process to separate mixtures of alkanes, as the boiling point of each alkane is reached, the alkane boils out of the mixture. Chemists can collect the vapour and condense it to obtain different alkanes with similar boiling points

#### Reactions of Alkanes

Alkanes are fairly unreactive, but they are used as fuels because their [[Complete Combustion]] release a lot of energy, an example:

$$2C_{4}H_{10}(g)+13O_{2}(g)\rightarrow8CO_{2}(g)+10H_{2}O(g)+thermal.energy$$
