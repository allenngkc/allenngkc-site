We know that there are two types of chemical bonding, Ionic and Covalent, more on [[Chemical Bonds]]

##### Covalent Bond
1. A non-polar covalent bond forms when the 2 atoms in a covalent bond share electrons equally. (Ex: Diatomic Molecules: $H_{2},N_{2}$)

3. Polar covalent bonds form between atoms that attract shared pairs of electron with different abilities to attract electrons (**Electrons are not shared equally**)

We have Hydrogen Fluoride $HF$, given that the value of $EN$ of $F$ is higher than hydrogen $H$, this means the [[Electron]] are **shared unequally**, causing the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge, while the fluorine atom has a partial negative charge.


#### Electronegativity

As the $EN$ difference increases, the ionic character of the bond increases.


| $\vec{\Delta} EN$ | Bond Type          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| $<0.5$            | Non-Polar Covalent |
| $0.5-1.7$         | Polar Covalent     |
| $>1.7$            | Ionic              |

> The polarity of a bond increases as the electronegativity difference increases.
