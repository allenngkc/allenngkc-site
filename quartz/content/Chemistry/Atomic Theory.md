[[Atoms]]

Little bit of history

Mendeleev 
-> Russian
-> made the 1st Periodic Table (had gaps, new elements still to be found)
-> classified elements by mass and chemical properties

Dalton
-> studied gases
-> atoms of different elements vary in size and mass, not all the same

John Thomson
-> proved that atoms were of smaller parts
-> discovered [[Electron]] and was negative
-> created the **Plum Pudding** model
-> electrons are embedded in a cloud of positive charge

Rutherford
-> British
-> worked at Mcgill, won nobel prize 1908
-> Gold foil experiment
> Observed that the deflection of alpha particles was caused by a concentrated positive charge at the centre of the atom. He predicted that the centre of the atom must contain most of the atomic mass

-> Rutherford Model, discovered the [[Proton]], same number of protons and electrons

> Problems of Rutherford
> 1. Why nucleus sticks together, don't want to repel each other?
> 2. When charged particles move near, Energy should give off, but there was no sign of it
> 3. Failed to explain the stablility of electrons in a circular path (He stated that electrons revolve around the nucleus in a circular path, but particles in motion would undergo acceleration and cause energy radiation. Eventually, electrons should lose energy and fall into the nucleus. **This would imply that atoms are naturally unstable**)
> 4.  Failed to explain why individual atom produce discrete line spectra (he thought it should be continous)

Bohr
-> Danish
-> The Bohr Model

> 1. [[Electron]] can only be in specific allowed energy levels called stationery states
> 2. Electrons in stationary states do not emit energy
> 3. When an $e^-$ moves to higher E level, absorb that specific amount of E
 >4. When an $e^-$ moves to lower E level, emit that specific amount of E

 > Each transition of energy level is a change in the atomic spectrum. (Different wavelength of light absorbed by the electron, causing it to change color)
 
 **Bohr addressed the Rutherford model by requiring that the electron move in orbits of fixed size and energy, electrons move in orbit with quantised potential and kinetic energies, so not possible for them to just occupy any energy level**
