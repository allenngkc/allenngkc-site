### The VSEPR Theory

stands for **valence shell electron-pair repulsion**. It's a method to determine the geometry of a molecule based on the idea that electron pairs are **as far apart as possible**.

By minimizing the repulsive force between electron pairs, we can predict the structure of the bond, atom, molecule. Take a simple example:

$$Cl-Be-Cl$$
>As the electron pairs wants to get as far as possible, we have $180\deg$ apart. (Or Linear structure) Which is an optimal arrangement.

Consider $BF_{3}$, 3 bonding electron pairs surround the boron atom. The farthest apart angle would be $120\deg$, also described as a **trigonal planar** structure.

> In similar senses, a **square planar** indicates a bonding with electron pairs at $90\deg$, $CH_{4}$

However there is another arrangement that would make $CH_{4}$, The **tetrahedral structure** has angles of $109.5\deg$

> There are situations where a molecule is non-polar but there is presence of polar bonds, An example of this would be $CCI_{4}$, Though the symmetry makes it non-polar, the $\vec{\Delta}EN > 0.5$, thus polar bonds. 

##### How to Determine the Central Atom?

In general, the least electronegative atom occupies the central position in the molecule, more in [[Electronegativity and Bond Polarity]]

##### Encountering Lone Pairs

when the central atom has 1 or more lone pairs of electrons, it will be affected. Take $NH_{3}$ as an example, which has a single lone electron pair.

> The lone electron pairs repels a little more than the bonding pairs, as a result, the bond angles decrease from $109.5\deg$ to $107\deg$. This forms a **trigonal pyramidal** structure.

###### Why Lone Pairs Have The Greatest Repelling Effect?

Since there's no atom on the other end of a lone pair, the charge density is spread out more.
