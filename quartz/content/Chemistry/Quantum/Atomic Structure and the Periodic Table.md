#### Multielectron atom

each orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s) has different levels of energy, due to **electron-electron repulsions.** 

The 2p orbital energy level is lower than a 2p electron in a hydrogen atom.

> since the more electron an atom has, the more attraction between the nucleus and the electrons, caused the atom to contract and decrease in energy

##### 3 Energy Contributions in an atom
1. The kinetic energy of the electrons as they move about the nucleus
2. The potential energy of attraction between the nucleus and the electrons
3. The potential energy of repulsion between the 2 electrons
