When constructing electron configurations or **(orbital diagrams)**, keep in mind with the Hund's Rule.

#### Hund's Rule
every atomic orbital within a sublevel is singly occupied before it is doubly occupied. And all singly occupied orbitals possess electrons with the same spin with $m_{s}=+\frac{1}{2}$

###### Why does Hund's Rule hold?
Electrons seek to minimize repulsion between other electrons, they always want to occupy their orbital where there is no other electrons to repel.

#### Dealing with Ions
when constructing the electron configuration of ions, we remove **electrons on highest energy level**
