#### The Four Quantum Numbers

Solutions to Schrodinger's equation for the hydrogen atom give many wave functions that describe various types of orbitals.

##### The Principal Quantum Number (n)

n equals to the energy level, it is the quantum number that describes the size and energy of an atomic orbital.

> It is important to note that the spaces between shells are not equal, (As n gets higher, the more energy needed to occupy that shell)

##### The Secondary Quantum Number (l)

describes the shape of an atomic orbital, the values is 0 to n-1.

Note:
s = 1 orbital, p = 3 orbitals, d = 5 orbitals, f = 7 orbitals

##### The Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_{l}$)

The value of $m_{l}$ is $-l\leq m_{l}\leq +l$, where l = the secondary quantum number

describes the orientation of an atomic orbital in space relative to other orbitals in the atom.

#### The Spin Quantum Number ($m_{s}$)

It seemed reasonable to assume that the electron could have two oppositely directed "spin states", two values $+\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{1}{2}$

#### The Pauli Exclusion Principle

In a given atom, no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers (n, l, $m_{l}$, $m_{s}$). 

An orbital can only hold two electrons, which must have opposite spins.


#### Important to Know

> Understand what $m_{s}$, $m_{l}$ do to the periodic table, if there are 3 values ms, meaning 3 electrons in each shell. The periodic table gets wider. The stable arragement would become (3, 12, 27, 48)

###### Why we should fill 4s first then 3d?
As energy levels gets higher, they got close together that they started to overlap, at which 3d has more energy than 4s
