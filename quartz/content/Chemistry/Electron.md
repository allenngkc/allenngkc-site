Electron are what surrounds the nucleus. It's relative charge is 1-

>Relative Atomic Mass = $0.00055$
>Mass = $9.1*10^{-31}kg$
>Charge = $1.6*10^{-19}C$

#### Discovering the Electron
by English Physicist JJ Thompson. He applied high voltage to a partially evacuated tube with a metal electrode at each end. And observed a ray produced from the negative electrode. **Cathode Ray Tube**.

#### Millikan Oil-Drop Experiment
When oil drops are sprayed, they will acquire a negative charge, some drops move up to the top plate and some accelerate downward. 

> He was able to halt the oil drops from falling by adjusting the voltage values

> After Millikan performing hundreds of iterations, and changing values of the voltage on one side. He was able to make electrons float in the middle $(F_{g}=F_{e})$. Then he was able to measure the smallest unit of charge

#### Photoelectric Effect
electrons are emitted by matter that absorbs energy from shortwave electromagnetic radiation (UV light)

During collision of photon and the electron, some of the transferred energy caused the electron to break away from an atom, rest is converted into kinetic energy

higher freq = higher energy photons
low freq = not enough energy

> Light has wave-particle duality, it is both particle and a wave
