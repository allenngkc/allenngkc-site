A permutation of $n$ distinct objects is an arrangement of all the objects in a definite order

> Definite order means **order matters**, at which the number of permutations is more than [[Combinations]]

The general rule for calculating the number of permutations of n objects is:

$$n\times(n-1)\times(n-2)...2\times1$$

$nPy$ can be expressed as $P(n,y)$

$$nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
