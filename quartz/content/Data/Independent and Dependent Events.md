###### Compound events
multiple things happening in a probability situation.

###### Independent Events
one event happening does not affect the other

##### Multiplicative Principle
The probability of two independent events A and B occurring is (with replacement):

$$P(A\cap B) = P(A)*P(B)$$

P(B|A) = the probability of B given that event A happened, where there is no replacement
$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}$$
or another form
$$P(A\cap B) = P(A)*P(B|A)$$
