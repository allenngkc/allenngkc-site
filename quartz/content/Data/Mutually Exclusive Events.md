When events A & B are mutually exclusive. then the events sets A and B are **Disjoint**, check 

The probability that A or B will occur is given by the addition rule for mutually exclusive events.

> In short, this means they are independent events, simply add the probabilities

$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$

P(A or B) = $P(A\cup B)$
P(A and B) = $P(A\cap B)$

### Not Mutually Exclusive Events

If two events are not mutually exclusive, this means that must share common outcomes

                $P(A\cap B)$ 

When events of A and B are non-mutually exclusive, the probability that A or B will occur is given by the addition rule:
$$P(A\cup B)=P(A) + P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
